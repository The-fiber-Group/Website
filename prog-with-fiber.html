		<h1 style="color:red;">The features and syntax shown below are subject to change!</h1>
		<h1>Basic Syntax</h1>
		<h2>Tokens</h2>
		<p>
			Fiber syntax is made of two kinds of tokens, <u>symbols</u> and <u>terminals</u>. 
			Symbols are used for keywords and naming things like variables or functions.
			Terminals are used for operators and delimiters.
			The two of these together are used to make various expressions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Symbols are made of alphanumeric characters and the dash character.
			Terminals are made of non-alphanumeric characters including the dash character.
			Because both symbols and terminals can use the dash character, symbols cannot begin or end with a dash.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's important to remember that <b>symbols are case-insensitive!</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a symbol: <code>a----sym-bol</code><br>
			This is the same symbol: <code>A----SYM-BOL</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is not a symbol: <code>--symbol--</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			All tokens are delimited by whitespace, blank characters, and other non-printable characters such as line feeds and tabs.
			There are no special characters or delimiting tokens.
			Additionally, symbols can delimit terminals and terminals can delimit symbols.
			These rules produce syntax that is slightly different than normal programming languages.
			For example:
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a pair of nested parentheses: <code>( ( ) )</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a single pair of double-paren delimiters: <code>(( ))</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the two expressions, <code>x*-</code> and <code>x* -</code>, the asterisk and dash form three different operators, <code>*-</code> from the first expression, <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> from the second due to their being separated by a space.
		</p>
		<p>
			This behavior may seem harder to read at first, but the requirement of verbose spacing between separate tokens reduces terse expressions that would normally be ambiguous in other languages.
		</p>
		<h2>Numbers</h2>
		<p>
			Numbers can be either decimal or hexadecimal.
			Decimal numbers can use a sign prefix and a radix point.
			Hexadecimal numbers use the digits 0-9 and the capital letters A-F and they have to be prefixed with "0x".
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are some examples of numbers:<br>
			<code>1</code><br>
			<code>1.1</code><br>
			<code>-0.010</code><br>
			<code>0xDEADBEEF</code>
		</p>
		<h2>Strings</h2>
		<p>
			Strings can contain ASCII characters, Unicode characters, or raw binary data as a "byte string".
			All strings are surrounded by double quotations.
			Byte strings replace the opening double quotation with a special opening quotation, <code>#"</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Strings are ASCII by default, unless they include a Unicode character via a UTF-8 encoded character in the source file or through a character escape sequence in the string.
			Single characters are escaped into a string using the backslash prefix.
			Double quotations and backslashes are included in a string like so: <code>"\""</code>, <code>"\\"</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			Non-printable characters are inserted using their hexadecimal encoded number.
			The space character would be escaped into a string using <code>"\20"</code>.
			Unicode characters are escaped by adding a capital U after the backslash and then a four digit hexadecimal number, <code>"\U20F0"</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Byte strings use a series of two-digit hexadecimal codes to specify each 8 bit byte value in the string.
			Spaces are allows, but not required between each number in a byte string.
			Ex: <code>#"01 FF A3"</code> is the same as <code>#"01FFA3"</code>
		</p>
		<h3>Character Literals</h3>
		<p>
			Character literals are represented simply by including only one character inside a string, <code>"A"</code>.
		</p>
		<h1>Data Types</h1>
		<p>
			Data types are declared by surrounding the data type definition in a closed pair of brackets, <code>[ ... ]</code>.
		</p>
